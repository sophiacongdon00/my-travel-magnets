## About the Collection

This website is a catalogue of travel magnets that Sophia collected during her travels between 2022 and 2024. There are 42 magnets in the collection, all from North America and Europe. Some of the magnets include audio files. These snippits of audio were recorded with friends that Sophia traveled with and detail the story behind the magnet.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
