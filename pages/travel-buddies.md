# Travel Buddies
Some magnet profiles include audio clips. These conversations are between my friends I've traveled with and myself. 

### Suki
Suki and I discuss our travels across Europe alongside the blue prague magnet, the three oranges magnets, the teapot magnet, and plaster bust magnet. Suki and I have been friends since 2015.


### Katherine
Katherine and I discuss our adventures with the Oregon cat magnet, the [Alicante house magnet] (https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=alicante-house-magnet), and the Guinness magnet. Katherine and I met during our study abroad program in Alicante, Spain in January of 2022.
