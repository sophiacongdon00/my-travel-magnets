# Travel Buddies
Some magnet profiles include audio clips. These conversations are between my friends I've traveled with and myself. 

### Suki
Suki and I discuss our travels across Europe alongside the [blue prague magnet](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=blue-prague-parent), the [three oranges magnets](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=three-oranges-magnets), the [teapot magnet](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=teapot-house-magnet), and [plaster bust magnet](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=plaster-bust-magnet). Suki and I have been friends since 2015.


### Katherine
Katherine and I discuss our adventures with the [Oregon cat magnet](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=oregon-cat-magnet), the [Alicante house magnet](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=alicante-house-magnet), and the [Guinness magnet](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=dublin-guinness-magnet). Katherine and I met during our study abroad program in Alicante, Spain in January of 2022.


### Emma
Emma and I chat about our trip to [New Orleans](https://sophiacongdon00.github.io/my-travel-magnets/item.html?id=cafe-dumonde-magnet) during the spring break of our senior year of college. Emma and I met in orchestra class during our freshman year of high school.
